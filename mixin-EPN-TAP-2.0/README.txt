this file (epntap2.rd) should probably be placed into 
/usr/share/pyshared/gavo/resources/inputs/__system__/

there is no need to keep epntap2.rd and epntap.rd separate, 
since only <mixinDef id="table"> and <procDef type="apply" id="populate">
need to be changed, and one RD file can have multiple definitions of these
however it may be more convinient to do so at the development stage 
to make it easier to edit.

I don't understand why does epntap.rd have a column "accref"
<column name="accref" original="//products#products.accref"/>
This exposes my input data table. Is that really necessary? 
Also there is no property accref in 

Here we have all min/max pairs generated by <STREAM id="_minmax"> 
which is then fed via <FEED>, eg
			<FEED source="_minmax"
				basename="t_sampling_step"
				baseucd="time.interval" unit="s"
				baseutype="Epn.Time.Time_sampling_step"
				basedescr="Sampling time for measurements of dynamical
					phenomena"/>

The defalut values are provided by <mixinPar>, eg
		<mixinPar key="c1unit" description="Unit of the first spatial
			coordinate">deg</mixinPar>
			
I'm confused what does <property key="std">1</property> mean?

New row definitions are taken from this table:
